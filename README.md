## Copy and paste code for the exercises

There are several exercise sections of the training sessions, where you get to try out what you've learned so far on your own.

To make it easier, the code from each slide is copied into separate pages, divided up by project and put in sections that make it easy to copy and paste. Here's a list of the projects:
* [The My_First_Blazor_App project in Part 1](https://github.com/andrewstellman/blazor-training/blob/main/1-spinning-up.md)
* [The math quiz console app project in Part 2](https://github.com/andrewstellman/blazor-training/blob/main/2-console-math-quiz.md)
